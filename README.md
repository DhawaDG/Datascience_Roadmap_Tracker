# ðŸš€ Data Science Roadmap Tracker
As an aspiring data scientist, I often struggled to track my progress effectively. To solve this problem, I developed this web application using **Streamlit**. It helps users like me manage their learning journey by providing a structured roadmap, progress tracking, and curated resources. I hope this app will also help others on their data science journey.
This project is a testament to my **problem-solving skills**â€”identifying a challenge and creating a solution for it.
You can explore the app here: [Data Science Roadmap Tracker](https://mydsjourney.streamlit.app/)
The app includes a detailed roadmap with stages, topics, and resources, allowing users to log their progress, edit the roadmap, and manage their learning journey.

## Features

- **User Authentication**:
  - Sign up and log in with email and password.
  - User-specific progress tracking.

- **Roadmap Stages**:
  - Predefined stages for learning data science, including Python, SQL, EDA, Machine Learning, and more.

- **Progress Tracking**:
  - Mark topics as completed.
  - View progress metrics (total hours, completed hours, remaining hours).

- **Resource Management**:
  - Access curated resources (books, documentation, videos, practice sites, research papers) for each stage.

- **Customizable Roadmap**:
  - Add, edit, or replace topics and resources as per your learning needs.

- **Database Integration**:
  - User data and progress are stored in an SQLite database.
